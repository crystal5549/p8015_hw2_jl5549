``` r
#import percipitation datasets for 2017 and 2018
prcp_2017 = 
  read_excel('./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx', 
                            sheet = 4, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>%

  read_excel('./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx', 
                            sheet = 3, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>%

#combine two datasets
prcp = 
  rbind(prcp_2017, prcp_2018) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)])
```

The number of the observations of first dataset is 285. This dataset
includes variables of dumpster number(dumpster), date of
collection(year, month, date), amount of total litter(weight\_tons) and
litter type(weight\_tons, sports\_balls etc). The number of the
observations of the second dataset is 21. This dataset includes
variables of precipitation amounts and associated dates(month, year).
The total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5. The median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8. The example is show as below.

The first dataset plos\_month contains datas from 1947 to 2015. It
contains 822 rows and 9 variables related to the number of national
politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time. The
president variable indicate whether the president was republican or
democratic on the associated date. The variable gov\_gop is the number
of republican governors on the associated date. The variable sen\_gop is
the number of republican senators on the associated date. The variable
rep\_gop is the number of republican representatives on the associated
date. The variable gov\_dem is the number of democratic governors on the
associated date. The variable sen\_dem is the number of democratic
senators on the associated date. The variable rep\_dem is the number of
democratic representatives on the associated date.

The second dataset snp contains datas from 1950 to 2014. It contains 787
rows and 4 variables related to representative measure of stock market
as a whole. The date variable is the date of the observation. The close
variable is the closing values of the S\&P stock index on the associated
date.

The second dataset unemployment contains datas from 1948 to 2015. It
contains 816 rows and 3 variables to indicate the employment rate on a
specific date. The last dataset is a merged on by the three above which
shows comprehensive information related to election of the associated
year. It contains 113124 rows and 14 variables where variable year is
the year of the measurements on that row.
