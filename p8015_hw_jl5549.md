The maximum of trash dumpster collected one day is 5.62 tons. The
maximum of trash dumpster collected one day is 0.96 tons. The total
numbers of plastic bottles collected in 2015 is 1.361310^{5}. The
maximum of precipitation in 2017 is 7.09. The total precipitation in
2018 is 23.5. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is
8.

The first dataset plos\_month contains datas from 1947 to 2015. It
contains 822 rows and 9 variables related to the number of national
politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time. The
president variable indicate whether the president was republican or
democratic on the associated date. The second dataset snp contains datas
from 1950 to 2014. It contains 787 rows and 4 variables related to
representative measure of stock market as a whole. The date variable is
the date of the observation. The close variable is the closing values of
the S\&P stock index on the associated date. The second dataset
unemployment contains datas from 1948 to 2015. It contains 816 rows and
3 variables to indicate the employment rate on a specific date. The last
dataset is a merged on by the three above which shows comprehensive
information related to election of the associated year. It contains
113124 rows and 14 variables
